# Sedge
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/NethermindEth/sedge)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/NethermindEth/sedge)

A one click setup tool for PoS network/chain validators. Currently, `sedge` is designed primarily for solo stakers and testnet devs of the Beacon Chain and the Merge (Ethereum). `sedge` generates docker-compose scripts for the entire on-premise validator setup based on the chosen client.

## üí• How this all started?

As people who actively work on The Merge, we know how hard it is to set up an Ethereum validator:
- You need to procure at least three (compatible) nodes: an execution node (geth, nethermind, etc), a consensus node, and a validator node (lighthouse, prysm, etc)
- You then need to execute them, connect them, monitor them, and secure the validator keys (which includes staking 32 ETH).
- There may be several valid combinations of clients to choose for your setup, so you need to go through each of the client's docs, evaluate it, get instructions for it and test it. You also need to feel comfortable executing commands in the cli, know docker, and understand basics of networking. On top of this, there are many different settings you must read up on and consider for your client node.
- In the case of working with the Ethereum Mainnet, you are working with real money that can potentially be lost in the event of having downtime or being slashed. To avoid losing real value, you must be aware of and follow best practices on the validator setup, and correctly monitor your nodes.
- Have you heard of MEV? Flashbots is working on an MEV-Boost component which will take your validator to another level of awesomeness. You most likely want to always be running the latest version, but you also most likely don‚Äôt have the time to understand the MEV-Boost architecture in and out, or how to successfully implement it into your environment.
  
> Enter sedge

We want `sedge` to take care of all of the above for you. With just a few clicks or steps, `sedge` can create an entire ethereum staking architecture that supports client diversity and Ethereum's latest features, while being completely free and open source. We want `sedge` to save you from making costly mistakes in this complex setup; along with hours or days of research, reading and testing. We want you to be able to stake easily with or without blockchain knowledge by giving you the tools to help this amazing community (and earn some good money of course üòâ).

We want to share our knowledge in this topic and create something that allows everyone to easily and safely set up lots of diverse validators. 

We don't want to stop at Ethereum. We also want to help stakers of other PoS networks/chains, so if your favourite chain is not here, you are more than welcome to contribute!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

### Installation (Only UNIX systems)

#### Using Go

If you have at least `go1.18.2` installed then this command will install the `sedge` executable along with the library and its dependencies in your system:

```
go install github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/cmd/sedge@latest
```

The executable will be in your `$GOBIN` (`$GOPATH/bin`) 

#### Manual

Generate the executable manually (need Go installed):

```
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge.git
cd sedge
go build -o sedge cmd/sedge/main.go
```

or if you have `make` installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge.git
cd sedge
make compile
```

The executable will be in the `sedge/build` folder

---
In case you want the binary in your main PATH (or you don't have `$GOBIN` in your PATH), please copy the executable to `/usr/local/bin`:

```
# Using go install
sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/sedge /usr/local/bin/
# Manually
sudo cp sedge/build/sedge /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Download binary from release page
1. Download correct binary for the machine you want to use for Sedge, i.e choose the correct target OS/Arch.
2. Set binary as executable with `chmod +x <binary>`. Replace `<binary>` with the name of the downloaded binary.
3. (Optional) Put the binary on path with `cp <binary> /usr/local/bin/sedge`

### Dependencies
`sedge` dependencies are `docker` with `docker compose` plugin, but if you don't have those installed, `sedge` will show instructions to install them, or install them for you.

### Quick run
With `sedge cli` you can go through the entire workflow setup:
1. Check dependencies
2. Generate jwtsecret (not for mainnet and prater)
3. Generate a `docker-compose` script with randomized clients selection and `.env`
4. Execute the `docker-compose` script (only execution and consensus nodes will be executed by default)
5. Validator client will be executed automatically after execution and consensus nodes are synced.
  
Between steps 4 and 5 you can generate the validator(s) keystore folder using `sedge keys`. 

The entire process is interactive, although you can use the `-y` flag to run Sedge without prompts.

Check all the options and flags with `sedge cli --help`. More instructions or guides about sedge's features will come soon!

### Run a validator with mev-boost on Ropsten

The following command takes care of the setup of a Teku consensus and validator nodes on Ropsten with a random execution client:

```
sedge cli --network ropsten -c teku
```

The `--network` flag allow you to choose the target network for the setup. Check out supported networks below. Default network is mainnet.

The `-c/-v` flag is to select the desired consensus/validator client for the setup. If you only use one of those flags, then the same client pair will be used for consensus and validator nodes.

There is also a `-e` flag to select the execution client. The default behavior is to choose a randomized client, that's why if we skip the `-e` flag this time, a randomized execution client will be used.

mev-boost is a default setting as long as Sedge supports mev-boost for the selected client and network. If you don't want to use mev-boost in this case, then add the `--no-mev-boost` flag to the command.

### Configuration file
When you run Sedge for the first time, it generates a `.sedge.yml` on your HOME directory. This file should look like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - docker

executionClients:
  - geth
  - nethermind

consensusClients:
  - lighthouse
  - lodestar
  - prysm
  - teku
 
validatorClients:
  - lighthouse
  - lodestar
  - prysm
  - teku

logs:
  logLevel: info
```

If you want to know what Sedge does in every step, then just read the logs. Sedge is logging every step. Some of the applied steps or commands are shown on the debug logs only. To see these logs you need to replace `info` for `debug` on the `logLevel` field.

You can modify the clients there to customize Sedge's random selection of clients. If you remove a client there, it won't be randomly selected. Be careful not to add an unsupported client, if this client is choosed you will face an error. Sedge knows very well which clients it supports.

You don't need to modify the `dependencies` field at all. If you alter it, Sedge may not work as expected.

## üî• What can you do with sedge today?

- Select an execution, consensus and validator node (manually or automatically) and generate a `docker-compose` script with production-tested configurations to run the setup you want.
- Generate the keystore folder using the [staking-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) tool with `sedge keys`
- Don't remember `docker-compose` commands or flags for your setup? Check docker logs of the running services with `sedge logs`, and shut them down with `sedge down`

> The setup is currently designed to start all three nodes required to run a validator (execution, consensus and validator node). Soon `sedge` will let you directly connect to a public or remote node. The execution and consensus nodes will be executed first, and the validator node will be executed automatically after those nodes are synced, giving you time to prepare the keystore file and make the deposit for your staked ether.

If you are familiar with `docker`, `docker compose`, and the validator setup, then you can use Sedge to generate a base docker-compose script with the recommended settings, stop Sedge instead of letting it execute the script, and then edit the script as much as you want. Is a lot more easier than doing everything from scratch!

> Although Sedge supports several clients, is still on beta. Some settings may not work because -at least on the testnets- the clients are constantly evolving. Please let us know any issues you encounter!
